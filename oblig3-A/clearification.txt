the set of ships is denoted by V, 
and the capacity ofship v∈V is K_v.

If we let i denote a cargo with the relevant amount of Q_i, 
there is a port i corresponding to the loading port and a port i+n corresponding to the unloading port, with n being the number of cargoes.

The set of loading ports is denoted by NP 
and the set of unloading ports is denoted by ND.

The set of ports that can be visited by ship v is N_v 
and this set includes an origin port o(v)
and an artificial destination port d(v).

The set of arcs that ship v can traverse is A_v. 
We also introduce the shorthand N‾P_v=N‾P∩N_v for loadingports that can be visited by ship v 
and N‾D_v=N‾D∩N_v for unloading ports that can be visited by ship v.

Each port has a time window [T__i,T‾_i].
The cost of sailing from i to j using  ship v is C_ijv 
and  the  associated  travel  time  is T_ijv.
The  time  at  which service begins at port i using ship v is t_iv 
and l_iv is the total load on board after completing service at port i using ship v.

The variables x_ijv are binary flow  variables,  indicating  whether  ship v moves  directly  from  port i to  port j.
Binary variables y_i indicate whether cargo i is transported by the available vessel fleet.

If the cargo is not transported with the available vessel fleet, a cost C‾S_i incurred. For industrial shipping, this corresponds to the cost of using spotcharter to transport the cargo.
